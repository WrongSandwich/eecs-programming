Evan Trout
Lab 11

Because this lab consists of two distinct data structures, I decided to separate them into separate menus
You select the type of data structure in the first menu, which then leads you to that structure's menu
I apologize if this makes testing harder, it made my development process much easier to follow

Other notes:
- Disjoint Set example data is in data.txt
- Graph example data is in graphData.txt
- Experimental Profiling input is experiment.txt, and raw output is first.csv and second.csv
    - I didn't think this was something you guys tested but if you want to run it it's menu option 6 for disjoint set
