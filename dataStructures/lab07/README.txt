Lab 7

My user interface is slightly modified from what is specified in the lab handout:


The BuildHeap function on the handout seems to be misnamed, as it's just levelorder printing the heap
The actual buildheap function is called automatically on file execution to build the heap from the input file
So I renamed the buildheap menu option to levelorder for clarity, and moved it to option 5 since it made more sense
