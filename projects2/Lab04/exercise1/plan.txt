first should check to see if length of string is odd or even
  if odd then it can't be balanced

compare parentheses on opposite sides to determine if opposites

with each call of recursive function
if string is empty, do nothing (base case)
if string has stuff (recursive case)
  check if last and first characters are equal
  if they are then remove those characters and call function again with new string

recursive function
{
  length = string.size();
  if (length == 0)
  {
      //String is done, return to main
  }
  else
  {
    if (string.substr(0, 1) == string.substr(length-1, 1))
    {
      recursive function(string.substr(1, length-2));
    }
    else
    {
      //the given string is not balanced
    }
  }
}
