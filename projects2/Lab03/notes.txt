Problem seems to be localized to CALL portion of Scheduler

This means it's likely something to do with the way I'm handling calling up
the current QProcess.

I think I need to alter things so that processes stay compartmentalized, since
attempting to use peekFront is not going to give me the address of the relevant
process so I can't use it to alter the processQueue like I'm doing right now.

This means this kind of stuff will also need to be changed in the RETURN section.

It would make sense since START is working fine but does not involve use of the
peekFront function at all.


Current heirarchy
main
  Scheduler (everything below here is a template)
    Queue (LinkedList -> Node) <QProcess<std::string>>
      QProcess <std::string>
        Stack (LinkedList -> Node) <std::string>
          function name
        Process name

Need to access function name and process name from scheduler, currently no
specific Queue functions to call that up
