main creates Exec with both file names

Exec creates 2 Grammars, one for question and one for answer (using their respective files)

grammar class stores a std::vector<ProductionRule>
Vectors should also be used to store intermediate strings, but an std::string must be returned to Exec
Limit depth of recursion to 8? "Select an alternative for each remaining nonterminal by selecting a rule" with no nonterminals
  - Implement this once you have the rest of the code written


VECTOR NOTES
Basically arrays with dynamically changing size
begin() - returns an interator pointing to the first element in the vector
end() - returns an iterator pointing ot the theoretical element that follows the last element in the vector
rbegin() and rend() - returns reverse iterators pointing to the last and first elements in the array, respectively
size() - returns number of elements
push_back() - push the elements into a vector from the back
pop_back() - remove elements from the back
insert() inserts new elements before the element at the specified position
erase() - remove elements from specified position or range
